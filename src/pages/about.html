    <p>My name is Jonathan M. Razon. I am twenty years old and originally from Boca Raton, Florida. I have three years of freelance graphic design
        experience and four years of weekly newsletter experience during highschool.</p>
    <p> While my talents for graphic design stem from watching my father paint when I was younger, I am a Biology major in undergrad with the intention of
        applying to dental school upon graduation.

    <p>
        My style of graphic design leans towards minimalist logo creation/web development.
