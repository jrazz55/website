<p>My name is Jonathan M. Razon. I am a pre-dent student who does graphic design as a hobby and passion. I started most of my work in the
    sunshine state, Florida, when I took my first graphic design class in the 9th grade. It wasn't long until I was the Editor of my highschool
    yearbook. Once I started college, I began to get hired to do freelance graphic deigning for companies around the south florida area.
